<p>I share this for my Mom, RIP.</p>
<p>It was 10 years ago tonight, an hour or so before midnight. It started with a frantic call and would end with just two words.</p>
<p>My phone rang. It was my brother Jimmy. Immediately I could hear the fear and desperation in his voice, asking when I had last talked with Mom. I had spoken to her several hours earlier. Part of me already knew. There is something wrong with Bobby. Mom woke up and found him laying on the living room floor. He is not moving or breathing. I heard his words but was in complete shock and disbelief. This was not happening.</p>
<p>I hung up with Jimmy and tried desperately to call my Mom. My Dad was already in route, as were other family members, to my Mom’s place. Being in VA while this was going on up in NY, I felt completely helpless. I eventually got word paramedics were already there trying to revive Bobby, while my poor Mom waited outside with others. This, a day or so before Mothers Day, would forever devastate my Mom to the day she died.</p>
<p>By this time I had woken Kelly who came downstairs completely confused as to why I was being so loud. I was numb and frantic at the same time. I just turned and repeatedly yelled that there is something wrong with my brother. There is something seriously wrong with Bobby. Endless minutes would pass not knowing, struggling to comprehend that this was happening. My mind then went to that place, and has ever since, where I asked myself why the hell didn’t I talk to Bobby when he walked through the door while I was on the phone with my Mom hours earlier. Just a few words may have mattered. I knew then I should have.</p>
<p>Eventually my phone would ring again. I could see that it was my Dad. I answered the phone and could hardly get the words out, dreading what he was going to say. All I could manage in a cracked voice was… Dad? Just hoping that he could somehow make it right. At that moment, time seemed to stop. At the corner of my eye I could see myself through Kelly’s eyes as she watched my devastation as I heard my Dad’s words. Raising her hand to her mouth.</p>
<p>Two words…</p>
<p>He’s gone.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://time.com/5635276/mueller-testimony-obstruction-conspiracy-analysis/">“Mueller’s testimony</a> yesterday highlighted the connection between obstruction and collusion. When he discussed his decision not to indict a conspiracy, he did not characterize it as one made because there was no evidence. It was because he did not have sufficient evidence – in other words, enough evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There was plenty of evidence of connection between the campaign and Russia, ranging from shared internal polling data to Trump’s request that Russia find Hillary Clinton’s emails to the appearance of the top tier of Trump’s campaign team at a meeting explicitly requested so the Russian government could provide election help to “Mr. Trump.” Mueller had plenty of smoke, but he lacked a smoking gun.”</p>

			 <p>Originally posted on 5/12/2016:</p>
<p>I share this for my Mom, RIP.</p>
<p>It was 10 years ago tonight, an hour or so before midnight. It started with a frantic call and would end with just two words.</p>
<p>My phone rang. It was my brother Jimmy. Immediately I could hear the fear and desperation in his voice, asking when I had last talked with Mom. I had spoken to her several hours earlier. Part of me already knew. There is something wrong with Bobby. Mom woke up and found him laying on the living room floor. He is not moving or breathing. I heard his words but was in complete shock and disbelief. This was not happening.</p>
<p>I hung up with Jimmy and tried desperately to call my Mom. My Dad was already in route, as were other family members, to my Mom’s place. Being in VA while this was going on up in NY, I felt completely helpless. I eventually got word paramedics were already there trying to revive Bobby, while my poor Mom waited outside with others. This, a day or so before Mothers Day, would forever devastate my Mom to the day she died.</p>
<p>By this time I had woken Kelly who came downstairs completely confused as to why I was being so loud. I was numb and frantic at the same time. I just turned and repeatedly yelled that there is something wrong with my brother. There is something seriously wrong with Bobby. Endless minutes would pass not knowing, struggling to comprehend that this was happening. My mind then went to that place, and has ever since, where I asked myself why the hell didn’t I talk to Bobby when he walked through the door while I was on the phone with my Mom hours earlier. Just a few words may have mattered. I knew then I should have.</p>
<p>Eventually my phone would ring again. I could see that it was my Dad. I answered the phone and could hardly get the words out, dreading what he was going to say. All I could manage in a cracked voice was… Dad? Just hoping that he could somehow make it right. At that moment, time seemed to stop. At the corner of my eye I could see myself through Kelly’s eyes as she watched my devastation as I heard my Dad’s words. Raising her hand to her mouth.</p>
<p>Two words…</p>
<p>He’s gone.</p>

			 <p>For all the bagging on the N.Y. Giants for reaching for Daniel Jones at #6, they weren’t necessarily the only team to reach for a QB. Don’t forget the historic #1 pick of, while extremely talented, a 5’10” QB by the Cardinals. Who just last year traded up to pick Josh Rosen, and dumped him for pennies on the dollar to the Dolphins. 🏈</p>

			 <p>I understand the media narrative hates the Daniel Jones pick at #6 by the N.Y. Giants. But it does appear the kid was highly rated by NFL insiders and many teams. And I absolutely believe the pre-draft reports that the Broncos and Redskins were in on picking him. If this kid is the real deal, the pick will be a steal.</p>

			 <p>Originally posted on Facebook, 5/12/2016:</p>
<p>I share this for my Mom, RIP.</p>
<p>It was 10 years ago tonight, an hour or so before midnight. It started with a frantic call and would end with just two words.</p>
<p>My phone rang. It was my brother Jimmy. Immediately I could hear the fear and desperation in his voice, asking when I had last talked with Mom. I had spoken to her several hours earlier. Part of me already knew. There is something wrong with Bobby. Mom woke up and found him laying on the living room floor. He is not moving or breathing. I heard his words but was in complete shock and disbelief. This was not happening.</p>
<p>I hung up with Jimmy and tried desperately to call my Mom. My Dad was already in route, as were other family members, to my Mom&rsquo;s place. Being in VA while this was going on up in NY, I felt completely helpless. I eventually got word paramedics were already there trying to revive Bobby, while my poor Mom waited outside with others. This, a day or so before Mothers Day, would forever devastate my Mom to the day she died.</p>
<p>By this time I had woken Kelly who came downstairs completely confused as to why I was being so loud. I was numb and frantic at the same time. I just turned and repeatedly yelled that there is something wrong with my brother. There is something seriously wrong with Bobby.
Endless minutes would pass not knowing, struggling to comprehend that this was happening. My mind then went to that place, and has ever since, where I asked myself why the hell didn&rsquo;t I talk to Bobby when he walked through the door while I was on the phone with my Mom hours earlier. Just a few words may have mattered. I knew then I should have.</p>
<p>Eventually my phone would ring again. I could see that it was my Dad. I answered the phone and could hardly get the words out, dreading what he was going to say. All I could manage in a cracked voice was&hellip; Dad? Just hoping that he could somehow make it right. At that moment, time seemed to stop. At the corner of my eye I could see myself through Kelly&rsquo;s eyes as she watched my devastation as I heard my Dad&rsquo;s words. Raising her hand to her mouth.</p>
<p>Two words&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gone.</p>

			 <p>Tough loss for Noah today and his 9U basketball 🏀 team. It was the first loss of the season. Still it was a learning moment that it&rsquo;s ok to have a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; game, learn from it, and come back that much stronger. Super proud of him.</p>

			 <p>The Giants were down 23-0 in the 4th quarter. I don’t understand why Webb is not active for this game. Would have been an ideal time to give the kid playing time. This #2 pick for the new GM/Coach could be a franchise altering decision. Just like taking Eli was in 2004.</p>
